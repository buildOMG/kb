## **Decentralized Exchange \(DEX\)** 

The DEX is a scalable and secure Proof-of-Stake blockchain on which any form of digital asset can be traded. All transaction orders will be managed on the DEX chain and validated by OMG stakers \(as part of the Proof-of-Stake, or PoS, consensus\), who collectively and dynamically determine the fees that are necessary to keep the network running, similar to how Ethereum or Bitcoin miners currently determine this \(but without the energy waste and other objections to Proof-of-Work mining\). The exchange will also be able to provide interoperability for all Ethereum tokens and for any Bitcoin \(or Bitcoin-like\) blockchain for fully on-chain cross-chain exchange.
