# What will OmiseGO do with themselves once the network is built?

Although Omise will use the network for their payments needs, neither Omise nor OmiseGO will own or control the network once it is deployed. It will be 100% public, owned by everyone.  


Our long-term profit model will be a combination of validator fees through owning and staking some tokens ourselves, and the aforementioned anticipated growth of our payments business with network effects of the interchange network creating the long-term value. We may also provide consultancy services to companies to implement OMG blockchain services \(not to be confused with charging fees to access the network, which is unilaterally not a thing\).
