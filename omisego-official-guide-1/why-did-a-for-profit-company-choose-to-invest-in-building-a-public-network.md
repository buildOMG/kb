# Why did a for-profit company choose to invest in building a public network?

Logically Omise, as a payments provider trying to keep ahead of the market, needs to support any popular digital wallet platform that may emerge. Omise’s customers must be confident that their end-customers’ needs are met, no matter what payment method they have chosen.  


Omise recognizes the need for infrastructure that nobody owns. While ostensibly, Omise could develop a centralized infrastructure for digital wallet interchange similar to existing card processors and clearinghouses, there is difficulty reaching sufficient stakeholder agreement for switching to a system around a single company  


Similar to open source software, there is significantly more incentive alignment around developing an open, decentralized system whereby participants can have assurance that they are not obligated to trust a single vendor. Our research projects as Omise Blockchain Lab, which ran from 2015 to 2017, indicate strongly that this path will bring greater adoption to this platform.
