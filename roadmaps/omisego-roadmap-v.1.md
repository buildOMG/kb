# OmiseGO Roadmap v.1

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*QzzyWzgRIjHoRVVBqH4hOA.jpeg)

_Editor’s note: This blog post is part of a series of posts that the OmiseGO team will publish about the technical architecture and implementation strategy of OmiseGO. This post focuses on updating recent activities and provides high level overview of the OmiseGO development roadmap, and will be followed with subsequent technically and strategically focused posts._

Our mission at OmiseGO is to deliver a public good, available to everyone, that can be used to build the next generation of financial services. This public good, a set of open-source technology designed to be used in a decentralized way, comprises 1\) the Wallet SDK; 2\) the Decentralized Exchange \(DEx\); and 3\) the OmiseGO network that is built to scale according to Plasma architecture.

The path to the implementation of components on this kind of scale is not straight. Rather, the path will be winding and scenic with multiple stepping stones along the way.

Our highest priority is to ensure the security of the OmiseGO network and all of its participants. With that in mind, we also understand the pressures of bringing real-life use cases to the market in an expedited manner.

We are pleased to share with the community our roadmap’s outline, defining our path to bring up the OmiseGO foundations and foster the growing ecosystem. In building this foundation, we have defined milestones that progressively layer on complexities and features.

**Progress**

Since the conclusion of the OMG crowdsale we have been working to carry out initiatives to build out the OmiseGO ecosystem which are vital to the growth of the overall network including:

\(1\) OMG Airdrop: The OMG airdrop — which was the first Ethereum token airdrop — was the automatic distribution of OMG tokens to all stakeholders in the Ethereum network, and was promised in the OmiseGO sale document as a way to distribute the OmiseGO network’s Proof-of-Stake \(PoS\) staking tokens to improve the OmiseGO network’s security, as well as was designed as a mechanism to encourage the tight alignment of all interests seeking to use the Ethereum network for token sales. The example we set worked; after the OMG airdrop announcement, a number of other Ethereum token sale projects have subsequently committed to doing airdrops of their own. To continue to promote this agenda, the OMG [airdrop setup and infrastructure](https://blog.omisego.network/omg-airdrop-code-release-4d3f5d6d117a) has also been made available for the public to utilize and further build upon.

\(2\) Strategic Partnerships: We have been working to grow the OmiseGO ecosystem through consistent community engagement and through the establishment of strategic partnerships with global finance players like [Global Brain](https://www.ethnews.com/omisego-global-brain-and-digix-global-to-establish-blockchain-accelerator) and [Krungsri Bank ](https://www.techinasia.com/omise-krungsri-finnovate-investment)\(MUFG\). We plan to launch an accelerator program in collaboration with Global Brain, as well as multiple blockchain labs. We believe this will contribute to the creation of a blockchain ecosystem that serves the community whilst fostering networking between projects via open source research and resource management. Through our partnership with Krungsri Bank \(MUFG\), OmiseGO products will power real-time money transfers and payments tools that are currently lagging behind their mobile and wallet customers needs. We are continuing to explore partnerships with other strategic partners to grow this ecosystem and to enable the global adoption of the OmiseGO network.![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*J8GraJJEd6HDkOlYNwZAoQ.jpeg)

**The Roadmap**

The path that leads to Plasma is marked by milestones we have named after relevant [terms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Go_terms) from the board game ‘[Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28game%29)’ \(碁\), invented in China over 2,500 years ago. Described in brief below are the milestones up until the OmiseGO Plasma chain is deployed. Greater detail about the milestones below and proceeding milestones will be described in follow up blog posts.

1 : Fuseki\(布石\) and Sente\(先手\)  
The first two milestones Fuseki\(布石\) and Sente\(先手\) are in respect to the white-label /wallet SDK.

In the game Go, ‘Fuseki’ represents the whole board opening, enabling various development and strategies on the board to take place. At OmiseGO we refer to our first milestone as Fuseki because it is the opening to our series of deliverables. Over the past few months our team of designers, developers, and financial experts have been working on Fuseki with our clients and partners to design and develop priority features for the wallet SDK, ensuring end users’ needs are front and center.

Adding further priority features and complexity to the wallet SDK, we refer to our second milestone under the name Sente. Sente is a move in ‘Go’ that retains strategic advantage for the player and controls the opponent’s response. Sente takes into account everything learnt during the workshops and the feedback received from partners during Fuseki. We expect Sente to demonstrate the value of the OmiseGO Wallet SDK and its utility in global customer loyalty programs. We are very excited to be putting Sente into the hands of developers in Q1 of 2018!

The first users and partners for the loyalty programs use-case will lead the announcement of their adoption of the wallet SDK once the solution has been fully integrated.

In parallel to Fuseki and Sente wallet SDK, the team is working on deployment of the OmiseGO network including Honte \(本手\), Aji \(味\), Tesuji \(手筋\) and Tengen \(天元\).

2 : Honte \(本手\)  
Honte in the game of Go represents a solid move, simple and robust. In Honte, OmiseGO will deliver the OmiseGO network and lay the foundations in preparation for [Plasma](http://plasma.io/). Development progress and news about Honte’s public release will be shared in one of the subsequent detailed product blog posts. Honte is currently on course to be delivered in Q1 to Q2 of 2018.

3 : Aji \(味\)  
The closest English translation of Aji \(味\) is ‘latent potential.’ Stemming from the Japanese term which means taste, Aji represents how stones provide options for play later in the game. In OmiseGO development milestones, the potential being added in Aji is the ability to move in and out of fiat and an interface to the Omise payment gateway.

4 : Tesuji \(手筋\)  
Tesuji \(手筋\) refers to a clever and skillful move, almost to the level of a ‘trick’ play. It requires the player to read ahead and pick the best play that might be decisive to the final outcome of the game. Tesuji was chosen to represent the impressive, innovative nature of Plasma. Tesuji will utilize the foundations that were built by Honte and Aji and introduce a basic form of Plasma with a novel bonded consensus mechanism.

5 : Tengen \(天元\)  
In combination with Tesuji, Tengen \(天元\) which means ‘origin of heaven’, represents the center point of the ‘Go’ board. In the Tengen development phase, we take Tesuji and deploy it on the finished OmiseGO network: a massively-scalable, cross-chain-compatible decentralized exchange \(DEx\) Plasma chain.

The goal is to improve the lives of people through the transformation of finance and digital commerce. By enabling people to both maintain unprecedented connectivity and retain unprecedented control over their individual financial resources, while at the same time have a stake in how the collective resource \(the OmiseGO network\) is operated, we are attempting to forge a path towards socioeconomic equity in a just, free market environment. In the course of delivering this goal, we also hope to contribute to the technology that enables scaling on a blockchain and to introduce new ways of performing peer-to-peer exchange of digital value.

The work involved is complex and new, and pushes the technological envelope. Our development teams take careful consideration in every step when designing, testing and deploying different phases. The roadmap, thus, should be treated as a flexible and living document that can be updated as development progresses forward.

We are grateful for the trust the community has placed in us to deliver on these goals and we are looking forward to sharing more specific details about our progress and milestones in the near future.
