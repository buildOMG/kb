The Tengen milestone is the “end game” milestone when the OMG network will be able to support sufficient transactions per second to compete with traditional financial services, have a decentralized exchange with cash-in/cash-out capabilities and interoperability with different blockchains. In the Tengen development phase, Tesuji will be deployed on the finished OMG network: a massively-scalable, cross-chain-compatible decentralized exchange \(DEx\) Plasma chain.
