# Plasma Cash

[Plasma Cash](https://ethresear.ch/t/plasma-cash-plasma-with-much-less-per-user-data-checking/1298): Assets deposited into a Plasma Cash chain are represented as non-fungible tokens \(NFTs\). Blocks are different from Plasma MVP, in that each Plasma Cash block allocates a slot for each token. When a token is transacted, a record of that transaction is places at the corresponding slot. Plasma Cash removes Plasma MVPâ€™s exit time constraints and reduces user storage and computation requirements by only requiring users watch their own value.
