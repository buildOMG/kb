[Tesuji Plasma](https://github.com/omisego/elixir-omg/blob/develop/docs/tesuji_blockchain_design.md) is the first iteration of OmiseGO plasma-based implementation. The design is based on Minimal Viable Plasma. Tesuji is currently on our internal testnet. Audits are in progress with Quantstamp and Synthetic Minds — those audits have already proved useful as we’ve received and reacted to some preliminary feedback. The internal testnet is an MVP implementation.
