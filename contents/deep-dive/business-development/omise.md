# Current State

{% hint style="warning" %}
_Please note: the OMG Network is still in development, and some details cannot yet be included. This knowledge base will be revised regularly to include updates and additional details._
{% endhint %}

Although we still can’t share a lot of details, we thought we’d at least include a sketch of our business development activities.

We’re continuing to engage with projects large and small who are interested to build on OMG, and preparing to open up our internal testnet to a select few. We’ve been working on proofs of concept with a few of our larger enterprise users, and one of our partners has a plasma chain running in a test environment. We’ve been focusing on loyalty points as an entry point for enterprise eWallet users who are interested to move onto the blockchain but not ready to jump all the way in. Points are low-risk and don’t have the regulatory complications that come with fiat or even cryptocurrencies, so it’s a good way to test the waters.

We’ve also been developing partnerships with exchange venues \(no, we can’t tell you which ones\) to bring volume and liquidity to the decentralized exchange. We’re working closely with those groups to make sure that the DEX has the features that they need in order to leverage the network effectively.
