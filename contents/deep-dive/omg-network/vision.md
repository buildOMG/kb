# Vision

Access to mobile devices and Wi-Fi services have become ubiquitous. Simultaneously, global commerce and human mobility and migration continue to grow. As such, the ability to conduct payments anytime and anywhere is a necessity.

At OmiseGO, we believe an open platform that allows global buyers and sellers to meet directly and conduct global settlement will pave the way towards a future where payments can happen anywhere in the world in a way that is fast, fair and secure. We see a world with a borderless, open, financial system that is accessible to everyone.
