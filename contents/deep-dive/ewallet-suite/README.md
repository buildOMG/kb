The eWallet Suite is a completely free and open source software toolkit developed by OmiseGO to seamlessly onboard merchants and users to the OMG Network. In the early documentation, this was referred to as an eWallet SDK, but that wasn’t really the whole picture. An SDK \(Software Development Kit\) is a set of tools to build out applications on a certain platform. Since the SDKs \(there are actually 3, one each for Android, iOS and Ruby\) are actually only a component, we’ve started referring to the whole toolkit as the eWallet Suite.

Once connected to Ethereum and plasma, users will be able to send, receive and store cryptocurrencies such as ERC-20, ERC-721, tokenized fiat, and so on. From there, we will expand the capabilities of the OMG Network to support additional currencies, working toward a fully currency agnostic exchange.

Fiat currency will be supported through plugins when cash-in and cash-out partners are onboarded in each target geography. The eWallet will be able to store fiat currency, noting that eWallet providers are responsible for regulatory compliance.

An eWallet is first and foremost a web application. As a means of interacting with the web-based eWallet platform, the Suite also includes:

* API: API stands for Application Programming Interface, and acts as an interface between different software programs \(e.g. the OMG eWallet and a provider’s existing wallet platform\)
* SDKs: Software Development Kits, toolkits for developers to easily build applications on a platform — in this case the eWallet, which will allow seamless integration with the OMG Network. These toolkits are particularly useful for those implementers who do not have the resources to develop specific software for integration with OMG.
* Front end admin panel for easy customization, account creation, token issuance, activity logs and more
* Back end application accessed either using an API to connect an existing application, or SDK \(to build a new app from the ground up\). Both server-level and mobile applications are supported, currently in iOS, Android and Ruby.
* Demo applications — currently not available on any app store, these are instead meant to provide a template for how the eWallet can be implemented.

The full suite of eWallet tools allows anyone to build and integrate a front end interface to mint, deposit, transact, track and withdraw digital assets; with tools for providers to customize apps to their specific needs.
