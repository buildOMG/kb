The next steps:

* Improve websocket support for the Android SDK

* Draft OIP for key management \([OIP-6](https://github.com/omisego/OIP/issues/6)\)
* Draft OIP for blockchain adapter \([OIP-7](https://github.com/omisego/OIP/issues/7)\)
* Start working on a new sample mobile application to illustrate merchant/user interactions allowed by the eWallet

We have also started migrating tasks from our private issue tracker to a [public issue tracker](https://waffle.io/omisego/ewallet) which uses [GitHub issues and PRs](https://github.com/omisego/ewallet/issues). This will allow everyone to more easily track eWallet development progress as well as encourage open discussion and contributions from the community \(that’s you!\) regarding feature implementation.
