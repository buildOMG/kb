* Add sync exchange pair for admin panel \([\#400](https://github.com/omisego/ewallet/pull/400)\)
* Add transaction request exchange pair for admin panel \([\#398](https://github.com/omisego/ewallet/pull/398)\)
* Basic load testing on the eWallet \([\#359](https://github.com/omisego/ewallet/issues/359)\)
* Refactor websocket package in Android and fix the connection bugs \([\#58](https://github.com/omisego/android-sdk/pull/58)\)
* Split the Android SDK modules \([\#64](https://github.com/omisego/android-sdk/issues/64)\)
* Work started on allowing providers to integrate the eWallet with mobile clients without the need for server applications \([\#357](https://github.com/omisego/ewallet/issues/357)\)

* The eWallet and Plasma teams held a workshop at Neutrino Tokyo \(full recap to come\) and got lots of feedback about eWallet’s installation procedure and its usability. We will incorporate that feedback into the eWallet in the upcoming weeks.

The next steps:

* Advanced filtering for Admin API
* Draft OIP for eWallet integration with the blockchain \([OIP-9](https://github.com/omisego/OIP/issues/9)\)
