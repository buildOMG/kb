# What are integration libraries?

{% hint style="warning" %}
_Please note: the OMG Network is still in development, and some details cannot yet be included. This knowledge base will be revised regularly to include updates and additional details._

The integration libraries are another tool to help developers easily build on OMG. These exist in the layer between web apps and the blockchain itself, providing the end to end infrastructure for integrating an end-user application, from application to library to watcher to child chain. The eWallet, as a web app, will also make use of this infrastructure to connect to the blockchain.
