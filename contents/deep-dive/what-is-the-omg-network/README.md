## **What OMG is made of?**

We’re building a frictionless, permissionless, trustless payments network as a public good. The OMG Network will serve everyone as a globally accessible decentralized exchange in which value of any type can be transacted. The key components of the OMG Network ecosystem are:

* eWallet Suite and Application Interface
* Plasma — A Blockchain Scalability Framework
* Decentralized Exchange Layer
* Proof-of-Stake Consensus Mechanism
