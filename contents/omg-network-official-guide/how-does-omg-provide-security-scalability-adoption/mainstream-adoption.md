## Mainstream Adoption?

Today, decentralized nance and cryptocurrencies are still quite foreign to the mainstream. Taking advantage of the many opportunities Ethereum can offer still requires a fair amount of technical knowledge, well beyond the scope of the average consumer. OMG’s white-label SDK is designed to be simple and friendly, allowing business users to create customer-facing wallet apps that utilize the OMG network without requiring a deep understanding of the underlying technology.

By creating the SDK, we are doing the legwork that will allow business users to plug into the network easily and build wallets that take advantage of Ethereum’s vast potential without compelling any behavioral change on the part of the end customer. Providers can customize wallets, building in whatever functions they need and incorporating their own branding.

Users will be able to experience the freedom to transfer money in and out of whatever currencies they wish, including decentralized currencies such as ETH and BTC. The OMG network is intrinsically agnostic between at and decentralized money: as far as adoption and use go, the system is constructed so that the best currencies will win.

End-customers will not necessarily know that their service is powered by OMG, they will simply know that it works and that they get benefits passed down in terms of reduced costs, real-time transactions, and increased access and flexibility.
