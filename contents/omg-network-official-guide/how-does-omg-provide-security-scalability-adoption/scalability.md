# Scalability?

## Scalability?

OMG solves the security vs. performance \(on-chain vs. o-chain\) dilemma by performing all orderbook and execution functions on-chain, on a specialized chain. The Plasma architecture allows for transactions to occur in real time, while state proofs are committed to and enforced by the root chain, so the OMG network can scale infinitely while still being secured by the Ethereum root chain.

Currently Ethereum is processing about 15 transactions per second, but we are building the OMG network to be able to handle all the worldâ€™s transactions simultaneously.
