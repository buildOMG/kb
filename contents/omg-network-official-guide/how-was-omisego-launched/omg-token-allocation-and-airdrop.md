## OMG token allocation & airdrop

**Total supply created = 140,245,398.245132780789239631**  
[_https://etherscan.io/token/OmiseGO_](https://etherscan.io/token/OmiseGO)\_\_

During the crowdsale period \(“OMG token creation period”\), up to a total of USD $25 million \(Maximal Launch Quantity\) equivalent of OMG were to be created by the smart contract, all equal value and functionality, but divided by the smart contract into different pools, for both public and private distribution:

**Public:**

1. Sale \[65.1% of OMG issued\] 
2. Airdrop \[5% of OMG issued\] 5% of the total amount of OMG tokens created were designated for an Airdrop, both to encourage wider adoption of decentralized network operation and as a thank you to the Ethereum community to raise awareness and keep community incentives aligned. In September 2017, these OMG tokens were automatically distributed to addresses which held more than 0.1 ETH as of block 3988888 on 7th July. Over 450,000 addresses received OMG tokens \(approximately 0.075 OMG per 1 ETH\). There are no more airdrops planned \(do not believe scams that advertise a future OMG airdrop and require the recipient to take action\).

**Private:**

1. OmiseGO reserve \[20% of OMG issued\] Directly released by the smart contract to OmiseGO for future costs and uses including use for network validation as part of the development and execution of the project. These OMG are locked through a smart contract function and may not be transacted by OmiseGO for a period of 1 year, starting from the end of the creation period. 
2. Team \[9.9% of OMG issued\] Reserved for team members and key contributors who worked to develop the ideas, supporting structures, and actual implementations of the OMG Project. Locked for 1 year.
