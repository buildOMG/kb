## **Decentralized Cash In/Out Layer** 

The OmiseGO digital wallet SDK allows integration with debit and credit cards for top-up and cash-out options, via ATMs or over-the counter. Our goal with cash in and cash out touch points is to create a network of banking, hardware, and retail partners where users can deposit and withdraw their cash. The cash becomes tokenized on to their wallet application of choice, and is immediately exchangeable for other tokenized currencies and assets via the OmiseGO blockchain.
