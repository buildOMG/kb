# OmiseGO AMA \#5

## What incentive would a successful centralized exchange have to connect to the OMG DEX and are there any recent developments on this?

The OMG DEX is designed to reduce the custodial risk when centralized exchanges hold user funds, and to allow end users to have complete control of their funds as much as possible. For a centralized exchange this could represent significant savings in the operational costs related to custody of user funds, with a reduction in both the amount of funds they are responsible for and the risk of funds being irretrievably lost. Established exchanges will have clear incentive to integrate the restricted custody DEX if they find that the operational cost savings outweigh the cost of adjusting their existing processes.

We are focusing on new and existing venues where the venue and their end users will clearly benefit from restricted custody, as well as venues that will find the eWallet’s functionalities useful once it is integrated to Ethereum and the OMG Network.

## The Crowdsale document stated Omisego \(not Omise\) is working with SBI Holdings, Mizuho Bank Ltd, Bank of Ayudhya and TrueMoney. Is Omisego still working with all these?

Yes

## What is the list of tasks remaining to do, before the public testnet?

In response to this, we’ve added some extra detail in the [tracker](https://github.com/buildOMG/tracker/projects/1) to the [Plasma External Testnet issue](https://github.com/buildOMG/tracker/issues/28), so you can follow along as tasks are checked off the list.

## Is Thomas Greco still with the OMG team?

Thomas’s role diminished over time as the need for it diminished, as OmiseGO moved out of the ideation phase and became an established project with clear direction and purpose. As a dedicated member of the Ethereum community, he was a key person in helping Omise understand how to add value to the Ethereum space from early on, and he remains a hopeful member of the OMG community.

## What is the next major Plasma Research problem that OmiseGO intends to solve?

A big push for plasma research in the near future will be thoroughly investigating the potential of Plasma Cash constructions, assessing the soundness of the current research and its ability to scale. At the time that implementation work on the OMG Network commenced, MVP was the clear choice based on the limitations presented by the extant Plasma Cash spec; but research has progressed rapidly over the past couple of months. Given these new developments, we're looking forward to exploring the potential of Plasma Cash-based constructions for long term scalability improvements.

## Now that yourselves and the Cosmos team have had a chance to collaborate on their most recent blog post regarding Cosmos DEX capability, is there any update available from the OMG side on the formerly proposed spoon? Will there still be a spooned token as described in [this](https://medium.com/@omise_go/o-m-forking-g-1cc257b890ec) blog post. 

Late bonus response, because we're finally able to give a complete answer:

The [roadmap update](https://medium.com/tendermint/an-update-on-the-plans-for-a-cosmos-dex-f69fd42dd1fc) from Cosmos was a general explanation of the order of events moving forward, including the point at which open source DEX software will be built and made available for anyone to use. OmiseGO's contribution was simply to give feedback about the clarity of that message.

The two main points to take from the update are that Tendermint is not pursuing efforts to build specific DEXes at this time, only generalized DEX software; and that the DEX software is slated to be implemented after both mainnet launch and IBC \(Inter-Blockchain Connectivity\) are completed. We'd still love to see an OMG zone on Cosmos when the infrastructure is in place, but given current circumstances the spoon proposed in April is not moving forward at this point.

We’ll do our best to finish clearing up ZOMG-specific questions here, including some of the statements that have been made in the Cosmos community channels.

The spoon was OmiseGO’s idea. When the decision was made to pivot away from Honte, the interim solution we had been working on with the Tendermint team, we looked for a way to continue to align with the Cosmos ecosystem and this seemed to be it. We had conversations with the Cosmos and Tendermint teams and got their feedback before putting out the announcement.

Tendermint made it clear from the beginning that their role would be in building DEX software, not operating it. OmiseGO was also clear that our core team would not be developing this platform. The plan was to turn this DEX over to a third party from the OMG community - built by Tendermint, supported by OmiseGO and stewarded by a third entity.

There was an entity from the OMG community which was willing to be the steward for this project \(we absolutely will not name the entity so please don't ask\). That entity has recently decided, in light of various uncertainties and an inability to come to a workable agreement between all parties, that it will not be able to go forward with that stewardship after all.

We’re disappointed by the way this has turned out - we wanted to work with Cosmos and Tendermint because we considered them friends and respected their tech. But they need to focus on getting their core product out, and we understand and support that. We’ll be doing the same.

## Bitter but better that it has been clarified. Most importantly, hope something similar is not repeated in the future. Due diligence and more scrutiny would help avoid such situations. Why didn't you disclose this by yourself earlier rather than disclosing it after repeated expressions of disappointment and questions by the community?

We're genuinely sorry for the confusion over the last couple of weeks. But we wanted to give a complete and final answer, which meant waiting until we had closure on the situation ourselves.

Where do you see the OmiseGO project in 3 years and what gives you confidence that OmiseGO will prevail over it's competitors?
