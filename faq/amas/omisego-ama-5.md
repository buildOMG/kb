# OmiseGO AMA \#5

## Really hate to bring this up but is there any particular reason the OMG hard spoon was announced back in the day on April Fool's, only to completely ignore the subject and passing on the hot potato to Cosmos who are returning the favor saying this is with the OMG team? Can anyone clear this up for once and for all so we can put a stop to this meme?

## What incentive would a successful centralized exchange have to connect to the OMG DEX and are there any recent developments on this?

## The Crowdsale document stated Omisego \(not Omise\) is working with SBI Holdings, Mizuho Bank Ltd, Bank of Ayudhya and TrueMoney. Is Omisego still working with all these?

## What is the list of tasks remaining to do, before the public testnet?

## Is Thomas Greco still with the OMG team ?
