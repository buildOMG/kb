# OmiseGO AMA \#10

## **Where will the bootstrap volume come from to test the testnet and to start the mainnet in the initial POA release?**

OmiseGO continues to develop business relationships as part of our mandate to facilitate adoption of the OMG Network. We are also actively engaging eWallet and Plasma collaborators, as well as enterprise partners. Although testnet transaction volume will come from these early implementers, we cannot predict what portion of volume will be comprised of which partners.

## **Can you shed any light on the acquisition of exchanges that was supposed to happen by the end of 2018?**

As a separate subsidiary under Omise Holdings, GO.Exchange operates independently under different regulatory and business/competitive conditions. We are not in the position to respond on their behalf. OmiseGO remains focused on building, shipping and supporting implementors interested in leveraging the OMG Network.

## **I understand that Plasma Prime has potential. But multiple chains/nested chains can do parallel block production to achieve huge scalability, Does Plasma Prime achieve parallel block production using Plasma validator sharding as given in link below or does it need some other technique?**

Plasma Prime reduces the amount of information that must be sent with each transaction. This contributes to scaling by requiring users to store less information. It’s not a replacement for Plasma chains on Plasma chains, it’s an entirely different architecture that scales by reducing data requirements. Plasma chains on Plasma chains is still aesthetically pleasing but is not an active area of research. Plasma Prime allows for sufficient transaction throughput to satisfy short and medium term demand. Sharded validation as referenced in Karl’s ethresear.ch post is just an idea at this point - it’s seemingly feasible but hasn’t really been fleshed out.

## **This just happened with ZRX. What are the chances this could happen with OMG? What are the possibilities that a customer or other entity will copy or fork the OMG project to streamline it for their own use without having to transfer fees to the OMG network?**

The decision to remove the ZRX token from the forked network in this case was due to its particular function as a fee token, which some felt added unnecessary friction for users of their platform. The OMG Network doesn’t require users to hold OMG tokens, only validators.

There was a good discussion of this in a recent daily as well. As some users pointed out in that thread, it’s always possible for another project or entity to fork the OMG code and do whatever they want with it – that’s the nature of open source. That said it would be a lot of work when said entity could just use the OMG Network, which is permissionless and costs nothing beyond the transaction fees paid to validators. As we well know, there’s a lot more to it than just writing code!

## **Have you had any dealings with HubrisOne who claim to be using OMG network and launching Q2 2109.**

The business development team is engaged with numerous parties interested in our services. HubrisOne is one project that has been in touch with us to discuss how they might leverage OMG as a solution that is decentralised, scalable and interoperable. Part of our model for supporting potential implementers is that it is up to those businesses to reveal their intentions when and if they choose.
